# Scout DAO

## The Problem / Background 

Aragon's Flock program is spending millions of dollars a year to fund teams that only output a handful of applications. These teams provide the cornerstone of Aragon's community/culture, but they don't (yet) produce a lot of real working products.

At the same time, the Aragon community is hesitant to make small bets on community driven ventures. The mental pain of paying 5k vs 50k vs 500k is relatively the same, but the financials are not. This results in applying the same amount of scrutiny and due diligence to all projects equally regardless of their risk/reward profile. This is unfortunate, however, because for the same price as 1 Flock team we could fund 2-3 10k Aragon experiments **per week** for a year. That’s 100 to 150 projects. An angel fund typically does a lot less DD than a growth fund. This makes sense because there are more data points to check in a growth round once a project has traction. Due diligence should be proportional with check size.

Open source software and products are neither profitable nor defensible. Platforms and network effects are defensible. Platforms have created and captured the majority of the wealth in the tech sector. Aragon as a platform will only succeed if A) it has a broad basket of offerings making it the "go-to" platform for DAOs, and B) it tries lots of things out to find product-market-fit (aka a "killer app").

Most startups fail. The process of asking customers what they want only works if A) there is an established market with customers who already know what they want, and B) startups reach out these customers constantly to maintain an ongoing relationship. This process does not scale. It takes incredible amounts of time and human capital. Many startups claim this was their key to success, but these are only the success stories. There is a graveyard of losers who did the same thing and failed.

To avoid almost certain failure, venture capitalists fund lots of experiments to create a **portfolio** of investments. This de-risks the venture because, while most will fail, there is a high likelihood that a few will succeed. Startups go all in on 1 idea. Most fail. Smart investors diversify and then double down on their winners. This has been proven to work throughout history. 

Aragon is a platform. To create network effects we need to create supply and drive demand. Currently we have like 10 apps that are shipped and 10 more in the pipeline. A platform cannot thrive with only 20 apps. We need more developers and more projects building on Aragon. Recently it's been shown that teams can start to develop applications like conviction voting, Aragon DAO explorers, and many more with super small uber-micro seed funding of ~5k. **5k!** We could literally fund 3 of these per week for a year for the same price as a Flock team, and then have money left over to pay for security audits and UX improvements. Think about it! 

We are over weighted on Flock and under weighted on bottom-up community ventures. We are doing ANT holders a great disservice by not pressing our advantage as a platform and funding low cost (low risk) high potential (high reward) community projects. It's cheap. It increases the amount of devs learning about and working on Aragon. It increases the value of Aragon as a platform.

We need an investment vehicle to do this. It needs to be fast, actively managed, and focused on experimentation. Currently we have the CFDAO, but it has incredibly low volume, is not actively managed, and often suffers death by committee. We also have the Nest program to fund 20-150k projects, but it takes over a month to process applications. We need an investment vehicle who's sole focus is to create deal flow, attract talent, and fund low risk experiments that can graduate to Nest or Flock. Typically angel and micro VC groups fund less than 1% of the deal flow they see. This filters only the highest quality deals, and most still fail. Aragon’s Nest program is funding X% (I think it’s north of 30%) of all deals that come to it’s doorstep. We need to increase the volume and quality of deal flow to the Nest program. This will greatly increase the amount of projects that actually ship production ready products and add value to the Aragon platform.

This vehicle needs to be actively managed. Managers need to identify, fund, and support projects that drive value to Aragon as a platform. This will function as a micro-seed fund that validates ideas of the Aragon community, attracts talent to the platform, and provides deal flow to the Nest program. 

## Scout DAO

To do this we propose ScoutDAO. ScoutDAO is simple. There is 200k in a vault (1/5 the recent ask of many Flock teams). There are managers who allocate funds. 

Managers can deploy up to 5k on their own. For amounts greater than 5k, a manager will need approval from another manager. This allows managers to make fast and decisive actions up to a point, but larger fund allocations will require more oversight. Deals that are a joint venture between managers will come from a 100k shared pool. This encourages managers to collaborate to ensure success of the program, but also encourages individual performance.

ScoutDAO is designed to operate at the stage before Nest DAO.  ScoutDAO will not fund more than X into any project. This will validate early community ideas and help them graduate to the Nest program. Higher quality deal flow to Nest will result in higher quality applications driving value to Aragon as a platform. 

The DAO’s operating costs, sourcing and evaluating deals, would be covered with a fixed monthly fee [see working section]. To align incentives and incentivize strong performance managers will also receive performance fees.  This will encourage managers to provide ongoing support to teams in order to ensure that they that ship a production ready product. This fee will be set at 10% of the project’s Nest grant and AA would pay this out to managers on a monthly basis. Bonuses will be sent to the ScoutDAO for managers to distribute based on performance. If multiple managers sign off on the funding due to it being larger than their individual allocation threshold, then they would split any resulting bonuses. This incentivizes managers to source high quality deal flow and fund projects with real potential. This also allows the community to clearly evaluate performance between managers.

Managers can also choose to share any part of their performance fees on a deal with other managers (or community members) if they feel that the member can add value to the deal. This will ensure that managers take actions that are aligned to maximize the success of deals. 

A hurdle rate will be introduced to further align incentives. Manager’s performance fees will be based on the hurdle rate of deals have graduated to the Nest program [see Manager Fee Structure section]. NestDAO members are trusted and knowledgeable members of the Aragon community. It is up to them to determine whether the deal flow provided by ScoutDAO is high quality. This aligns ScoutDAO performance with NestDAO evaluation. This is good because the purpose of ScoutDAO is to provide deal flow to the Nest program. 

Initial managers would be Joe Charleworth and burrrata. Additional managers could be added to the DAO by a vote of current managers. As this reduces the pie that current managers would have to allocate (and thus be rewarded for), any manager additions would have to be a value add above and beyond any potential losses. This aligns incentives so that managers will only add other managers who will add outsized value to the DAO, thus enabling the DAO to raise more capital from ANT holders in the future. 

For 20% the price of current Flock teams we could fund 20-30 high quality Aragon experiments. Many of these would graduate to the Nest program and ship production ready products for end users. This would help the community validate ideas, get more devs working on the Aragon stack, and greatly increase the value of Aragon as a platform. 

## Appendix

### Workings

Estimated total man hours to evaluate a $8k deal: 5 hours. 

 25*5=125 hours

At $100 ph, works out to be $12,500.   (NB: as % of funds, that equates to 6.25%)

$12,500 / 4 = $3,125 (The monthly fee payable to the DAO)
