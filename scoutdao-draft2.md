# Outline

Whatâ€™s the problem(s) with Nest DAO? 
- Not enough deals are coming in
- Interests are not aligned
  - None of the members are being paid to due diligence deals
  - None of the members are being paid if the projects they evaluate succeed 
- Nest DAO is operating more like an angel/seed fund, investing 50k-150k. But there is a funding gap at the family & friends / angel stage. Super early projects are not getting funded and not apply for funding. This is hampering innovation in the Argaon network.
- The result? 
  - Very Low deal flow volume.
  - Poor due diligence 
  - Long decision making times  
 
ScoutDAO 
- What is it? 
  - An Aragon DAO dedicated towards sourcing and funding deals that are too early for NestDAO.
  - Acts as a deal generator for NestDAO
- Why will it solve the problem for NestDAO?
